<h2>How to Play Sonic Eclipse?</h2>
<div class="description-section">Playing Sonic Eclipse is a fun and engaging experience, especially with its new and modified mechanics. Here’s a quick guide on how to master Sonic’s abilities:</div>
<div class="skills-section">
<div class="skills-grid">
<div class="skill-steps"><strong>Jump Dash</strong>: Sonic now has a jump-dash ability, which you can perform by double-jumping. However, this move consumes five rings each time you use it and makes Sonic temporarily vulnerable. Use it wisely to navigate tough terrain or evade enemies.</div>
<div class="skill-steps"><strong>Spindash</strong>: Fans of Sonic’s older games will love the spindash move, which works similarly to the adventure and generations-style spindash. To execute this move, simply press the C button (or D if you’re playing on a keyboard) to charge and release Sonic’s classic spin attack.</div>
<div class="skill-steps"><strong>Boss Battles</strong>: To defeat bosses, especially Eggman, remember that you can roll while in the air. Timing your air-rolls can be crucial in avoiding damage and striking at the right moments.</div>
</div>
</div>
<h3>What is Sonic Eclipse?</h3>
