<h2 style="text-align: center;">📥 Download Sonic Unleashed Recompiled</h2>
Want the latest version? Don’t go hunting around sketchy sites.

We’ve made it simple just hit the button below to get the <strong>official release</strong> of <em>Sonic Unleashed Recompiled</em> straight from the GitHub page. This is the real deal. No modified builds, no weird installers. 100% safe.
<blockquote>⚠️ Important: This port does <strong>not</strong> include the game files. You’ll need to dump them yourself from an original Xbox 360 copy. Keep reading — we’ll show you how.</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">🛠️ How to Install Sonic Unleashed Recompiled (Step-by-Step)</h2>
Alright, installing this isn’t super complicated, but there <em>are</em> a few things you’ve got to do right. Follow this guide carefully and you’ll be playing without errors in no time.
<h3 style="text-align: center;">✅ What You’ll Need First</h3>
1. Before running the installer, make sure you have all of this:

2. A legit copy of <em>Sonic Unleashed</em> for Xbox 360 (US or EU version — JP isn’t supported)

3. The <strong>Title Update</strong> (needed to patch the game)

4. Optional but recommended: all <strong>DLCs</strong> (better lighting, more content)

Either:
<ul>
 	<li>The game disc + a way to dump it to ISO</li>
 	<li>Or the game files dumped from an Xbox 360 hard drive or USB stick</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">🧩 Installation Steps</h3>
<h4>1. Extract the Installer</h4>
After downloading <em>Unleashed Recompiled</em>, unzip it anywhere you like. Run the <code>.exe</code> — it’s the main installer.
<h4>2. Choose Your Language</h4>
Pick your preferred language — Spanish, English, whatever works. Hit <strong>Next</strong>.
<h4>3. Add the Game Files</h4>
This is where it gets specific.
<ul>
 	<li>If you dumped your game as an <strong>ISO</strong> or a big container file, click <strong>“Add Files”</strong>.</li>
 	<li>If you’ve got the extracted game folder (with <code>.xex</code>, <code>.ar.00</code>, etc.), use <strong>“Add Folder”</strong>.</li>
</ul>
Make sure the installer lights up green under <strong>Game</strong>. That means it detected everything correctly.
<h4>4. Add the Title Update</h4>
Same deal — click <strong>Add Files</strong> again, select the Title Update you dumped.
<h4>5. (Optional) Add the DLC</h4>
Click <strong>Add Files</strong>, select all your DLC files (usually 6). They’ll boost the visuals big time.
<h4>6. Choose Install Location</h4>
Pick where you want the game to go. Make sure you have at least <strong>10 GB</strong> free.

Hit <strong>Next</strong>, and the installation will start. Wait for it to finish — it might take a few minutes depending on your drive speed.
<h3>🧠 Important Notes</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Do <strong>not</strong> try to install if your files were modified or patched. It’ll fail.</li>
 	<li>Don’t use compressed formats (.zip, .rar, .7z). Unzip everything first.</li>
 	<li>You only need to install once — future updates just overwrite the files. Your saves are safe.</li>
 	<li>If anything crashes or looks weird, don’t reinstall — check the FAQ instead.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">🚀 Unleashed Recompiled Features</h2>
Look — <em>Unleashed Recompiled</em> isn’t just “the same game but on PC.”

This is a full-on upgrade. A full rebuild. A love letter to <em>Sonic Unleashed</em> that fixes everything that used to hold it back.

Here’s what’s new (and why it matters):
<h3>✅ Native 60+ FPS With Fixes!</h3>
No emulation. This thing runs natively on your PC. Out of the box it’s capped at 60 FPS, but you can unlock it for higher refresh rates.
And unlike past attempts, this version actually fixes the bugs that used to pop up at high FPS. Stuff like broken animations or physics glitches? Gone.
<blockquote>You can finally play Jungle Joyride at 144 FPS... without the game exploding.</blockquote>
<h3>🖼️ High-Resolution Graphics</h3>
Supports full HD, 2K, 4K, ultrawide — all the good stuff.
Visual upgrades include:
<ul>
 	<li>Better motion blur (with new enhanced mode)</li>
 	<li>Fixed depth of field (no more blurry mess)</li>
 	<li>Clean anti-aliasing (MSAA, A2C, bicubic filtering)</li>
 	<li>Optional color correction toggle (Xbox 360 vs PS3 look)</li>
</ul>
Basically, this is the best Sonic Unleashed has <em>ever</em> looked.
<h3>🎮 Full Controller Support (PS &amp; Xbox)</h3>
Plug in your Xbox or PlayStation controller — it just works.
Button prompts auto-switch based on what you're using.
Bonus: DualSense and DualShock 4 support LEDs and even the touchpad on the world map.
<h3>🏆 Achievements Are Back (And Better)</h3>
Achievements have been recreated from scratch.
You’ll get in-game popups and a sleek new trophy menu — no need for Steam or RetroAchievements.
100% it and you get a shiny gold trophy screen. Oh yeah.
<h3>💡 Real Options Menu (Finally)</h3>
There’s now a full modern options menu, accessible in-game and at the title screen.

You can tweak everything:
<ul>
 	<li>Resolution</li>
 	<li>Framerate cap</li>
 	<li>Motion blur style</li>
 	<li>Color filter</li>
 	<li>UI alignment (for ultrawide setups)</li>
 	<li>Werehog battle music toggle (!!)</li>
 	<li>Hints/tutorials on/off</li>
 	<li>Cutscene aspect ratio</li>
</ul>
It feels like a proper PC game. Because it is.
<h3>💾 Mod Support via Hedge Mod Manager</h3>
Mods are fully supported with the latest <strong>Hedge Mod Manager</strong>.
You can use mods made for <em>Sonic Generations</em>, or older <em>Unleashed</em> ones.
No need to mess with game files — the mod loader handles it clean.
<blockquote>And yeah, it works on Linux and Steam Deck too.</blockquote>
<h3>🧠 No More Shader Stutter</h3>
One of the best things? The game precompiles shaders in the background.
That means: <strong>no stuttering</strong> when new effects or objects pop up.
No emulator can do this. Not even close.
<h3>🧱 Low Input Lag, Built-in Fixes</h3>
Input lag is minimized with modern rendering methods (like waitable swapchains).
The game feels snappy and responsive, especially during fast daytime sections.
<h3>🧲 Steam Deck Support</h3>
Runs natively on Linux.
There’s even a Flatpak version that works out of the box.
If you’re using the 64 GB model, install via microSD or external storage — it’ll save you space.
<blockquote>Performance is surprisingly great — way smoother than original hardware.</blockquote>
<h3>🧰 Quality-of-Life Features (That Actually Matter)</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Disable the annoying Werehog combat music</li>
 	<li>Skip transformation cutscenes</li>
 	<li>Turn off tutorials</li>
 	<li>Auto-mute background music if you're playing your own soundtrack</li>
 	<li>Controller D-pad support (even for the menus)</li>
</ul>
