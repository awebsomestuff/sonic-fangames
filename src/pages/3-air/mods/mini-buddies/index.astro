</div>
</div>
<h3>Latest Updates</h3>
<h4>Beta Release: Version 1.0</h4>
<div class="description-section">The very first beta version of the mod is now live and available for download! You can access it through <strong>AIR.drop</strong> with a one-click installation process. The mod comes with customizable templates that you can use to modify your buddies, giving you the freedom to design your own companions.</div>
<div class="description-section"><strong>Note</strong>: While this is a beta release, meaning things are still in progress, it's a great chance to experience the mod and share feedback with the development team.</div>
<h3>Mini Buddies: A Variety of Over 15 Characters</h3>
<div class="description-section">Inspired by Amy Galore's Tiny Pals, this mod introduces <strong>MINI Buddies</strong>—tiny companions that follow Sonic throughout his journey on Angel Island. With <strong>over 15 different characters</strong> to choose from, each with unique animations and quirks, you’ll have plenty of fun customizing your experience.</div>
<div class="description-section">Some buddies can fly, while others are grounded, offering a mix of play styles. One important note: grounded buddies do not behave like Tails. They have their own mechanics that differ from Sonic’s usual partner.</div>
<h3>Quirks and Animations</h3>
<div class="features-section">
<div class="features-grid">
<div class="feature-item"><strong>Running</strong></div>
<div class="feature-item"><strong>Idle</strong></div>
<div class="feature-item"><strong>Look Up</strong> (Grounded Buddy only)</div>
<div class="feature-item"><strong>Crouch</strong> (Grounded Buddy only)</div>
<div class="feature-item"><strong>Hurt</strong> (In Development)</div>
<div class="feature-item"><strong>Cling</strong></div>
<div class="feature-item"><strong>Victory</strong> (In Development)</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="description-section">These animations bring your buddies to life as they accompany you on your adventure. Grounded buddies have special animations like "Look Up" and "Crouch," making them feel more dynamic and integrated into the gameplay.</div>
<h3>Carry Your Buddy: Special Mechanic</h3>
<div class="description-section">One of the most exciting features of the <strong>MINI BUDDIES eXtra Quills MOD</strong> is the ability to <strong>carry your first-slot buddy</strong>. By pressing <strong>Y</strong>, you can lift your mini buddy and carry them around as you move through the game. This feature is especially useful for grounded buddies, as it helps you traverse the map more easily.</div>
<div class="description-section">Letting go of your buddy is simple: just press <strong>Up</strong> to release them. Though a throwing mechanic is in the works, for now, this carry feature adds a new layer of interaction to the gameplay.</div>
<h3>Super Forms for All Buddies</h3>
<div class="description-section">Every single MINI buddy in this mod has a <strong>Super Form</strong>! When you transform, your buddies transform right along with you, glowing with power as they take on new abilities. Whether you’re flying through the levels or just running around, your mini companions will always keep up. And here’s an exciting feature: you can choose to keep your buddies in their <strong>Super Forms</strong> even when Sonic reverts back, regardless of the emerald count.</div>
<h4>Customization Templates</h4>
<div class="description-section">Want to make your buddies truly unique? The mod includes templates that allow you to <strong>customize</strong> the sprites of your buddies. These templates are available on the mod's <strong>GB page</strong> and make it easy to design skins that fit your style.</div>
<div class="description-section">Feel free to create and share your designs—no need to ask for permission to post your skin mods. Just make sure not to steal or redistribute the scripts from the mod itself.</div>
<h4>Final Notes</h4>
<div class="description-section">The <strong>MINI BUDDIES eXtra Quills MOD</strong> is still in development, and <strong>nothing is final</strong> yet. That means sprites, scripts, and mechanics may change before the final release. If you encounter any bugs, be patient; the developer is actively working to polish the mod and deliver an exceptional experience.</div>
<div class="description-section">For now, enjoy the beta release, customize your buddies, and share your feedback with the development team to help shape the final version of this exciting mod.</div>
<div class="description-section">The <strong>MINI BUDDIES eXtra Quills MOD</strong> is an exciting addition to the <strong>Sonic 3 AIR</strong> experience, offering players a chance to travel with unique, customizable companions through Angel Island. With the beta release now available, you can dive in and start exploring the vast possibilities of over 15 characters, each with their own Super Forms and quirky animations.
