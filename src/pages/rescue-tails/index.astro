<div class="description-section">Sonic 2: Rescue Tails is an exciting fan-made reimagining of the 8-bit version of <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</em> from the Sega Master System and Game Gear, now re-envisioned in the classic 16-bit style of the Sega Genesis/Megadrive games. In this version, Doctor Eggman has kidnapped Tails, and it's up to Sonic to save his sidekick once again. This fan project, spearheaded by Laiker2003 and collaborators, delivers a blend of nostalgia and new elements that appeal to both veteran fans and newcomers.</div>
